#AirBnB Clone Front-End Development
##Background Context
I am embarking on the journey of creating the front-end for our AirBnB clone project. Before diving into the complexities of a web application, we are taking it step by step. The initial focus is on designing, sketching, and prototyping each element.

Creating Simple HTML Static Pages: This involves crafting the basic structure of web pages using HTML, serving as the foundation.

Style Guide: Defining the styling and design elements using CSS to enhance the visual appeal.

Fake Contents: Generating mock content to populate our web pages.

No Javascript: We won't be incorporating JavaScript in this phase.

No Data Loaded from Anything: This means we're not retrieving real data from external sources just yet.

Our primary goal during this project is to gain a solid grasp of HTML and CSS. HTML lays down the structural groundwork for web pages, making it the logical starting point. CSS complements this by providing the styling and design aspects. It's worth noting that getting the HTML structure right is crucial before delving into the finer details of styling. Without a solid structure, applying design elements becomes challenging.

Before starting, please ensure you have forked or cloned the "AirBnB_clone" repository from your partner if you were not the original owner of the previous project.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I aim to have a comprehensive understanding of the following concepts, allowing me to explain them without relying on external resources:

General
What HTML is and how to create an HTML page.
The concept of a markup language and its application in web development.
Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM) and its role in web document representation.
The meaning of HTML elements and tags.
How attributes can be used to provide additional information to HTML elements.

A solid understanding of CSS, including how to add styles to HTML elements.
The concept of classes and selectors in CSS.
How to calculate CSS specificity values to resolve style conflicts.
Familiarity with various box properties in CSS, which control element size, spacing, and positioning.
This project is a foundational step in the development of our AirBnB clone, and mastering these concepts will be instrumental in building a robust and visually appealing front-end.
